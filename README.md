# hello-world
... Not sure what to say for this. Beginner thing I'm doing I guess...
Hello everyone. My name is Vincent.(not really but that's what I'm going by on here)I thought this might be a cool thing to do, something of a fresh start to a new life and more friends. I love the Five Nights at Freddy's games and I enjoy them very much! I'm about 16. I love anything like pokemon, digimon, bakugan, Yu-gi-oh, Beyblade, etc... I'm an enthusiastic person and will happily try to make friends with people here, but if you've met me in real-life you'd know that I'm shy around new people and somewhat nervous when put into new situations. I'm kind and caring (unlike the character I'm named after) and would love to try my best to help others with problems and issues they may have. I am a total noob at this kind of thing so hopefully there are people out there that would like to help me improve and developmy skills.
